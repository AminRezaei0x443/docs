# Startup Idea Analyzer with CrewAI and uAgents


## Introduction

This guide demonstrates a Startup Idea Analyzer built using CrewAI and uAgents. It leverages specialized agents to assess market demand, technological feasibility, and business strategy. The agents collaborate to provide a comprehensive evaluation, helping entrepreneurs validate their startup ideas efficiently.

## Startup Idea Analyzer

This guide showcases how to use Agents to analyze a startup idea by performing market research, technological assessments, and business planning. It employs two different systems: uAgents (for agent-based communication) and crew_ai (for task-driven collaboration).

### Features

- Market Research: The Marketing Agent dives deep into understanding the demand for your product, defining the ideal customer, and crafting strategies to reach a wide audience.
- Technological Analysis: The Technology Expert Agent assesses essential technologies needed to create your product efficiently and with top quality.
- Business Strategy Development: The Business Consultant Agent synthesizes the information into a comprehensive business plan. This plan includes key strategies, detailed milestones, and a timeline to guide you toward profitability and sustainability.
- Provides over 10 crucial insights
- Identifies 5 clear business goals
- Generates a detailed timeline charting your path to success

### How It Works

Imagine a system that not only aids in market analysis and technology assessment but also provides you with a tailor-made business blueprint for success. Here's how it works:

1. Market Research: The Marketing Agent conducts thorough research to understand market demand, customer demographics, and effective marketing strategies.
2. Technological Analysis: The Technology Expert Agent evaluates the necessary technologies, offering insights on the best tools and methods for your product development.
3. Business Strategy Development: The Business Consultant Agent consolidates all gathered information to create a comprehensive business plan, including strategies, milestones, and a timeline.

### uAgent System

- It defines an Agent called "startup idea analyser" that interacts with other Agents using a protocol. The Agent listens for messages containing a startup idea `description` and forwards this input to a market research process, which returns a response based on the input.


```py copy filename="agent.py"

from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType
from uagents import Agent, Context, Field, Model, Protocol
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

from crew_ai import MarketResearchProcess

AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = os.environ.get("AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY")
SEED_PHRASE = "YOUR_SEED_PHRASE"

agent = Agent(
    name="startup idea analyser",
    seed=SEED_PHRASE,
    mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
)

protocol = Protocol("Startup idea Analyser version", version="0.1.2")
researcher = MarketResearchProcess()

print(agent.address, "agent_address")

fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())


class StartUpIdeaAnalyser(Model):
    description: str = Field(
        description="describes the field which will be the description of the startup idea and it is provided by the user in context"
    )


@protocol.on_message(model=StartUpIdeaAnalyser, replies={UAgentResponse})
async def on_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: StartUpIdeaAnalyser):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}, message {msg.description}")
    result = researcher.run_process(msg.description)
    await ctx.send(
        sender, UAgentResponse(message=result, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
    )


agent.include(protocol, publish_manifest=True)


agent.run()
```

### crewAI System

This script defines a `MarketResearchProcess` class that sets up a market research workflow using three specialized agents: a `Market Research Analyst`, a `Technology Expert`, and a `Business Development Consultant`. The class creates and assigns tasks to these Agents, such as analyzing market demand, assessing technological needs, and developing a business plan. It then uses the `Crew` class to execute these tasks sequentially, passing the results from one task to the next, and returns the final outcome.
