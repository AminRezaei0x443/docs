# Agentverse: allowed imports

## Introduction

The [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) provides **full Python support** within the Agent code editor so to allow you to develop any idea you may have using [Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent), the Agentverse, the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) and [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav), while maintaining security and control.

Furthermore, the Agentverse provides support for additional third-parties packages including `openai` and `langchain`.

## Multi-file Support

The Agentverse Code Editor enhances your agent development experience with multi-file support, enabling you to tackle complex projects with ease. Leverage this feature to:

    - **Interact between files**: simply import functions, classes, and variables from one file to another.
    - **Modular development**: divide your projects into manageable components for streamlined creation.
    - **Code reuse**: utilize modules across various sections of your project for efficient development.
    - **Enhanced organization**: maintain a structured and organized codebase for easier maintenance.

If you want to create **new files** you just need to click on **+ New File** on [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) inside your managed agent.

You can create a Python message file with the following `Model` class:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Model

    class Sentence(Model):
        text: str
    ```

Then, you can just import the `Sentence` data model to your `agent.py` file and make use of it:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Context
    from message import Sentence

    @agent.on_interval(period=2.0)
    async def print_message(ctx: Context):
        msg = Sentence(text=f"Hello there my wallet address is {agent.wallet}.")
        print(msg.text)
    ```
