# uAgents - `uagents` Framework

## Introduction
uAgents
The **`uagents` Framework** is a lightweight library designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **uAgents**. uAgents in a multi-agent system can communicate with any, and all uAgents in the system to solve problems, execute tasks and transact.

      Head over to the [`uagents` package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) to download it and start developing your uAgents!

      Current version of the `uagents` package is <PackageVersion packageName="uagents" packageType="pypi" />.

uAgents are autonomous software program built using the `uagents` framework and that can interact autonomously with other uAgents in a decentralized environment. These uAgents can operate in a decentralized manner, but their decentralization remains optional and dependent on individual preferences or needs.

Intelligent uAgents can fundamentally change the way we see complicated systems. For example, supply chain management could deploy uAgents using the `uagents` Framework to improve operations at various stages. Demand forecasting, inventory control, logistics optimization, supplier relationships monitoring, quality control and risk mitigation in all areas can be done with their help. uAgents could transform supply chain operations by increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving accuracy and providing real-time visibility.

These uAgents are the basic building blocks that allow developers to gain access to the tools and resources provided by the `uagents` Framework, enabling them to create and participate in intelligent and self-managed systems that can be used in various real-world domains.

## Why uAgents

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-related products, autonomous intelligent uAgents have become the link between these models and tools. They are revolutionizing the way we solve problems, make decisions and collaborate with each other.

The financial industry is another example. In this scenario, the automation of trading transactions, risk assessment, fraud detection and customer support would be greatly aided by uAgents. They can use predictive analytics to perform real-time market trend analysis, perform risk assessments for loans and investments, and create customized financial advice for clients based on their profiles and the state of the market. By continuously monitoring transactions and patterns, they could also help to detect fraud, strengthening security measures. uAgents in the financial sector have the potential to simplify processes, provide insightful information and improve decision-making for both financial companies and individual investors.

In this context, Fetch.ai introduces the **`uagents` Framework**. Using this open-source framework, developers are able to create intelligent, autonomous uAgents and join a decentralized network of many uAgents to effectively tackle the challenges of the modern world. uAgents only perform tasks specified by the developers, and these tasks can be precisely described by coding customizable behavior for specific use cases and scenarios.

The concept of uAgents refers to autonomous, decentralized systems that overcome conventional limitations. uAgents provide a gateway to a future where intelligent uAgents, empowered by the Fetch network and the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), can communicate, negotiate and collaborate to streamline complex tasks, solve complicated problems and improve decision-making processes in various fields.
