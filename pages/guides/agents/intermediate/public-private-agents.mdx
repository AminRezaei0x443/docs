# Public and private uAgents

## Introduction

Transparency is a fundamental principle in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain systems. Within the Fetch.ai network, **users have the ability to determine the amount of information they wish to publish**. This is thanks to the ability for users to create uAgents as either **public** or **private**, based on their **introspectivity** and **protocol exposure** through the [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) platform.

This allows users to provide greater flexibility to uAgents, creating a balance between transparency and privacy for every operation they perform on the network.

## Defining public and private uAgents


There are two ways in which an uAgent can be classified as public, they define an endpoint and or, they publish their manifests:

        ```python

            agent = Agent(
                name="demo agent",
                seed=SEED,
                endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
            )
            agent.include(new_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
            agent.run()

        ```

Private uAgents can be private in two ways, by hiding a protocol they use from public, and or not defining an endpoint:

```python

            agent = Agent(
                name="private demo agent",
                seed=SEED,
            )
            agent.include(new_protocol, publish_manifest=False)
            agent.run()

        ```

You would need to share the ip of the private uAgent you're running to other uAgent you're communicating with.
