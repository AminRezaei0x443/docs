# Options for running your uAgents

## Run a local uAgent with an endpoint

In some scenarios, you may want to run an uAgent on your own hardware or infrastructure; luckily this is very easy to do on any system that support **Python 3.10**.

This system is pretty simple, as to get you started as quickly as possible. We're going to run this uAgent on any device you'd like, in this scenario we're running on a VM but you could run this on your laptop, raspberry pi or tweak for Agentverse. On startup our script will register our uAgent to the [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview), and then our uAgent will be available to communicate with other uAgents.

## Imports needed

    - [`uagents` ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/)
    - [`uagents-ai-engine` ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents-ai-engine/)

### The agent

Consider the following Agent:

    ```py copy filename="agent.py"
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol, Model
    import random
    from uagents import Field
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType
    import sys

    agent = Agent(
        name="dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll",
        port=6145,
        seed="RANDOM STRINGS",
        endpoint=["http://YOUR_IP:6145/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())

    @agent.on_event("startup")
    async def hi(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(agent.address)

    class Request(Model):
        dice_sides: int = Field(description="How many sides does your dice need?")

    dice_roll_protocol = Protocol("DungeonsAndDragonsDiceRoll")

    @dice_roll_protocol.on_message(model=Request, replies={UAgentResponse})
    async def roll_dice(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Request):
        result = str(random.randint(1, msg.dice_sides))
        message = f"Dice roll result: {result}"
        await ctx.send(
            sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
        )

    agent.include(dice_roll_protocol, publish_manifest=True)

    agent.run()
    ```

To correctly run this code, you need to provide the `name`, `seed`, `port` and `endpoint` parameters.

You'll need to be running this uAgent on infrastructure that allows you to **open a port**; in our example, we run on port `6145`.

The uAgent is initialized with an endpoint, and a port; this is so that we can receive messages, and other uAgents know where to send them. We call `fund_agent_if_low` to get some funds, if we need them. And we define our protocol, which is just an `int` as seen in the `Request` object.

Our `on_message()` doesn't do much other than return a number between 1 and the defined `dice_sides` from the message inclusive. However, the response type is of `UAgentResponse` which is essential to communicate with [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav).

`.run()` initializes the uAgent.

Finally, we  run our uAgent as follows: `python agent.py`

**Expected output**:

    ```
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Manifest published successfully: DungeonsAndDragonsDiceRoll
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Registering on almanac contract...complete

    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:6145 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

## Run a local uAgent using a Mailbox

Through the **Agentverse** you can set up [Mailboxes ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/mailbox) for your local uAgents, allowing them to communicate with other uAgents registered on the Fetch Network without the need to be constantly online and without requiring your constant presence to operate.

### Local auAgentgent setup

Let's start by creating a local uAgent named `alice` with a `handle_message()` function using an `@agent.on_message()` decorator to handle messages received by other uAgents and matching the `Message` class:

        ```py copy
        from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
    
        class Message(Model):
            message: str
    
        # First generate a secure seed phrase (e.g. https://pypi.org/project/mnemonic/)
        SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"
    
        # Copy the address shown below
        print(f"Your agent's address is: {agent.address}")
    
        # Now go to https://agentverse.ai, register your uAgent in the Mailroom by providing the address you just copied.
        # Then, copy the agent's mailbox key and insert it here below inline
        AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "put_your_AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY_here"
    
        # Now your uAgent is ready to join the agentverse!
        agent = Agent(
            name="alice",
            seed=SEED_PHRASE,
            mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
        )
    
        @agent.on_message(model=Message, replies={Message})
        async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
    
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            agent.run()
       ```

To correctly run this code, you need to provide the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY`, `SEED_PHRASE`, `name`, `seed`  and `mailbox` parameters.

You can easily create a Mailbox by first retrieving your local uAgent address and head over to the **Agentverse: My Agents** tab. Here, click on **Local Agents** and click on **Connect Local Agent**.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse:mailbox/mailbox_1.png)

You will need to provide the address of the local uAgent you wish to retrieve and wait for confirmation. You will then need to provide a **name** for the uAgent.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse:mailbox/mailbox_2.png)

Once you do so and confirm, you will see a **Mailbox API Key** showing up. Paste it within your local uAgent code above by filling up the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` field inline.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse:mailbox/mailbox_3.png)

You can then restart your uAgent, now your uAgent doesn't need to run all the time as their messages will be waiting for them for when they come back online!

      You can find additional information on the Agentverse Mailbox feature [here ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-mailbox/utilising-the-mailbox). This resource shows how to setup two uAgents: one locally and one on the Agentverse and create a two-way communication line between these two uAgents with both uAgents sending a message to one another on an interval.
