# uAgents storage

uAgents storage is an important concept to understand how uAgents work within the `uagents` Framework. You can use the `Context` object to modify storage information related to your uAgent. While writing the code for your uAgent, you can add within an event handler, different methods retrieved using `ctx` (i.e., the uAgent's `Context` object) to retrieve and edit storage values.

For instance, you could use the `set` method of the `Context` object to set the uAgent's local storage by simply running:

    ```py copy
    ctx.storage.set("key", "value")
    ```

This will save the information in a **JSON file**. This information can be retrieved at any time using the `get` method of the `Context` object:

    ```py copy
    ctx.storage.get("key")
    ```

For a practical understanding of the concept of storage, have a look at the [Using uAgents storage function ↗️](/guides/agents/storage-function) guide in the [uAgent guides ↗️](/guides#agents) section for a step-by-step example showing how to retrieve and set storage values.

The [How to book a table at a restaurant using uAgent ↗️](/guides/agents/booking-demo) and the [How to use the uAgent to simulate a cleaning scenario ✨ ↗️](/examples/agents-cleaning-demo) guides in the [uAgent guides ↗️](/guides#agents) section, instead, shows a more complex and real-world demonstrations making use of the uAgen's storage concept.
